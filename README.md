# Color Changer

Color Changer is a simple bash script for changing my color schemes in both my Alacritty and Neovim config files simultaneously. It includes a script for tab autocompletion. If passed an argument which is a valid color scheme, it will make the changes to the relevant config files. If not, it will initiate an interactive prompt with a list of all available color schemes.

## Assumptions

Color Changer makes some assumptions about your environment:

- You are on a Mac or BSD machine (the `sed` command differs slightly on Linuxâ€”a cross-compatible version is in the works).
- Your Alacritty config file is at `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml`
- Your Neovim color scheme is set at `~/.config/nvim/color.vim`
- In your Alacritty config file, your color schemes are saved using `&` to alias each scheme.
- Each Alacritty alias matches the name of the same colorscheme in your Neovim config.
  - example:
    ```yml
    ayu: &ayu
      primary:
        background: '#1f2430'
        foreground: '#cbccc6'
        bright_foreground: '#f28779'

      normal:
        black:   '#212733' #
        red:     '#f08778' #
        green:   '#53bf97' #
        yellow:  '#fdcc60' #
        blue:    '#60b8d6' # 
        magenta: '#ec7171' #
        cyan:    '#98e6ca' #
        white:   '#fafafa' #

      bright:
        black: '#686868'
        red: '#f58c7d'
        green: '#58c49c'
        yellow: '#ffd165'
        blue: '#65bddb'
        magenta: '#f17676'
        cyan: '#9debcf'
        white: '#ffffff'

    colors: *ayu
    ```

If any of these are not true, the scripts are well-documented and can be easily altered to meet your needs.

## Using the script

1. `git clone https://github.com/eee-vvv/terminal-color-changer.git`
2. `cd terminal-color-changer`
4. `source ./_color_changer_completion`
